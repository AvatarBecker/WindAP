## WindAP - WindAP is not dull Arduino Project

A tube-and-ball project (fan blowing a ball up a tube) using computer vision (OpenCV in C++, the "WindAPP" -- WindAP is not a dull Application) for measuring 
the ball's height in the tube and WiFi (ESP8266 running NodeMCU in AP mode, the "WindAP" -- WindAP is not a dull Access Point) to send PWM values to the motor.

This was my the final project for the course Avanced Control (Controle Avan√ßado) at UFPR (Federal University 
of Parana).

You can check a short video of it working [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt4mrXorbtQ).
