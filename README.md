## WindAP - WindAP is not dull Arduino project

A tube-and-ball project (fan blowing a ball up a tube) using computer vision (OpenCV in C++) for measuring 
the ball's height in the tube and WiFi (ESP8266 running NodeMCU in AP mode) to send PWM values to the motor.

This was my the final project for the course Avanced Control (Controle Avan√ßado) at UFPR (Federal University 
of Parana).

You can check a short video of it working [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt4mrXorbtQ).
